This folder contains scripts that you should edit via a pull request. 
Make a change that prints, e.g. I would add 

cout << "This is the result of Patrick's pull request!" << endl;

in C++ or

print("This is the result of Patrick's pull request!")

in Python in between the respective comments.

See https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions for how to make a pull request.



To actually run these scripts, follow these instructions:

C++:
g++ cpp_pull.cpp -o program.exe
./program.exe

Python:
python python_pull.py

If run from terminal, these should print some things to the screen.
